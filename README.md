# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This is a Repository that has the code for Tumor detection with various MRI's. 
This has a total of 253 images labelled as "yes" and "no"
There are 155 images in "yes" and 98 images in "no"
In this, Data Augumentation has been performed on the dataset to compensate for the less amount of data.
Transfer learning has also been used. I have used VGG16 on this dataset, however there are many other trained neural networks such as ResNet50, Inception V3, Inception Resnet V2 and more.
I have included the data and attached the code in this repositary for your reference.
